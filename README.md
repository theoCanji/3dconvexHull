**Files**

`DCEL.py` is where we made our DCEL class to hold the convex hull. It has additional classes like Vertex, Edge, and Face. The DCEL class contains the code to plot the hull and to update it as points are added.

`helpers.py` a file of helper primitives and functions that are used in the random incremental convex hull algorithm or in the DCEL. 

`RandIncHull.py` the file that holds the code for the random incremental convex hull class that runs the algorithm and holds the DCEL representing the hull.

`test.py` is the file that runs the tests for the random incremental convex hull algorithm, including runtime, visualizations, and correctness (is convex?).

**Functions in DCEL.py**

`example(args)` an example function with example usage.
